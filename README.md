# Fluid Flow Simulation

This project is an implementation of fluid flow simulation method developed by Jos Stam.
The simulated fluid is wrapped around both in x and y borders resulting in torus topology.
In order to visualize the flow of the fluid, some parts of the fluid are dyed and the dissolution of the dye in the flowing fluid is rendered in real-time on screen.
